function [lmindist,mindist,pl,I,inttype]=intersec(l1,l2)

%INTERSEC (Spacelib): finds the intersection of two lines. 
%
% It builds also (if possible) the plane which contains the two lines. 
% Builds the minimum distance line and evaluates the distance between 
% the lines.
%
% Input parameters
%      l1,l2    : line structures whose intersection must be evaluated
% Output parameters
%      lmindist	: is a line orthogonal to l1 and l2 which has the minimum
%		 distance from l1 and l2
%      mindist	: the module of the minimum distance between l1 and l2
%      pl	: plane that contains l1 and l2
%      I	: intersection point of l1 and l2
%      inttype	: defines which kind of intersection was found
%		  1 = point I is not real intersection, only middle point
%		      between two oblique lines. Plane pl does not contain
%		      really l1 and l2
%		  0 = point I is the intersection of l1 and l2. Plane pl
%		      contains the two lines
%		 -1 = there are infinite intersections (l1==l2). Plane pl is
%		      undefined
%		  2 = there aren't any intersections because l1 and l2 are
%		      parallel . Plane pl can be found
%
% Usage:
%
%		[lmindist,mindist,pl,I,inttype]=intersec(l1,l2)
